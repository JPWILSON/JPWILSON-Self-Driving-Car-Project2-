# Development of a Convolutional Neural Network

This repo describes the LeNet-5-based classifier I designed and implemented to recognise traffic sign images.
[This](https://github.com/JPWILSON/JPWILSON-Self-Driving-Car-Project2-/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb "Traffic Sign Image Classification") is a link to my jupyter notebook which describes the project steps.

The classifier is a convolutional neural network, and was trained using Tensorflow.
