# Development of a Convolutional Neural Network

* This repo describes the LeNet-5-based classifier I designed and implemented to recognise traffic sign images.
* [This](https://github.com/JPWILSON/JPWILSON-Self-Driving-Car-Project2-/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb"Traffic Sign Image Classification") is a link to my jupyter notebook which describes the project steps.
* Trained using Tensorflow.
* This repository contains my submission for Project 2 of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. 
* The writeup contains details of this convnet used for image classification.
